# CST-323-Activity
## Milestone 1: 08/27/2023
This is a simple web application built with Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and using Maven dependencies.  
It will follow the MVC design.  MySQL will be used as the database running on MAMP for this first part of the assignment.  
The goal of this application is to learn how to deploy an application onto cloud servers.
As a personal goal, I will attempt to keep all code organized in packages based on features.  Currently, I am using a user package to keep everything regarding the user database, UserModel, and UserController.
My 2nd personal goal is to practice using separate git branches when I work on a new feature.  This will help me learn to collaborate in the future.  

## Milestone 2: 09/03/23
Added the option to delete users from the database.
